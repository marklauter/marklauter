## My Life Story in 5 Short Paragraphs
These days I'm Cloud Solutions Architect at [Insight](https://www.insight.com/). 
That's a fancy way to say I design and build cloud-based distributed software systems for my clients.
I have achieved [George Constanza's dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_hOP_K6MY). LinkedIn even sends me job notices for architectural firms.

When I was 9, I was introduced to computer programming and the lambda calculus. That was way back in 1978.
Right after high school, I volunteered to serve in the US Army where I crewed Cobra attack helicopters. 
When the glamor of extended camping trips in the desert wore off, I came home, shook the rust off my brain, and headed back to school. 
I was fortunate enough to participate in the engineering co-op program at Tampa Electric. Before finishing my two-year degree, TeCom, a 
sister company of Tampa Electric, hired me as a software engineer. That was around 1993.

Since then I've worked for early internet startups (late 90s), IoT and GIS startups, early AI and machine vision startups, and several fin-techs. 
I also owned and operated a small software engineering consulting firm for 18 years. 

In 1996 I wrote my first domain-specific programming language (DSL) for an electric utility billing report system. In 1998 I wrote my second DSL 
for server-side dynamic HTML rendering. And in 2008 I wrote a GIS query DSL for a custom GIS database with temporal-spatial sharding.

I have programmed professionally in BASIC, FORTRAN, C, C++, Delhpi, C#, VB.Net, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Perl, LISP, and many less relevant languages like Object PAL. 
If I had to pick a favorite, C# and C would both be in the running. These days I'm trying to catch up with functional programming and 
writing a property graph storage engine (like Neo4j).

## Github starters
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m writing a [SQL parser](https://github.com/marklauter/sql-parser) with [Superpower](https://github.com/datalust/superpower) to complete the Code Crafters SQLite challenge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about category theory because monads make me happy.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on writing a graph database storage engine.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding how database transactions interact with the buffer pool and write-ahead log.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: try the issues section on this repo.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I first interacted with a computer via a [Teletype Model 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MikoF6KZjm0). I have no idea where the actual computer was located. We played [Star Trek](https://makinggamesbyyear.itch.io/star-trek-1971). Each screen refresh was laboriously printed by the teletype. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.
