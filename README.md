# Mark Lauter
Cloud Solutions Architect at Insight

## Introduction
I was introduced to programming and the lambda calculus in 4th grade. That was 1978. I've been addicted ever since.
In 1987, right after high school, I volunteered to serve in the US Army where I crewed Cobra attack helicopters.
When I finally grew tired of the long camping trips to the desert, I came home, shook the rust off my brain, and got started in community college. Between semesters, 
I participated in the engineering co-op program at Tampa Electric. Before finishing my two-year degree, TeCom, a 
sister company of Tampa Electric, hired me. That was around 1993.

Since then I've worked for early internet startups (late 90s), IoT and GIS startups, early AI and machine vision startups, and several fin-techs. 
I also owned and operated a small software design consulting firm for 18 years.

In 1996 I wrote my first domain-specific programming language (DSL) for an electric utility billing report system. In 1998 I wrote my second DSL 
for server-side dynamic HTML rendering. And in 2008 I wrote a GIS query DSL for a custom GIS database with temporal-spatial sharding.

I have programmed professionally in BASIC, FORTRAN, C, C++, Delhpi, C#, VB.Net, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Perl, LISP, and many less relevant languages like Object PAL. 
If I had to pick a favorite, C# and C would both be in the running. These days I'm trying to catch up with functional programming and 
writing a property graph storage engine (like Neo4j).

Today I work as a Cloud Solutions Architect at Insight, which is a fancy way of saying I help clients design and build distributed 
software systems for AWS and M$FT Azure. I have achieved [George Constanza's dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_hOP_K6MY).

## Github starters
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently writing a SQL parser to complete the Code Crafters SQLite challenge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about category theory.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on writing a graph database storage engine.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding how database transactions interact with the buffer pool and write-ahead log.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever.

- âš¡ Fun fact: The first time I interacted with a computer was via [Teletype Model 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MikoF6KZjm0). I have no idea where the actual computer was located. We played [Star Trek](https://makinggamesbyyear.itch.io/star-trek-1971). Each screen refresh was laboriously printed by the teletype. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.
